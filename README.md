This section focuses on classification problems, such as predicting loan creditworthiness and risk modeling.

#### Notebooks:
- **[Classification.ipynb](Classification/Classification.ipynb)**: Introduction to classification techniques and their applications.
- **[LoanCredit.ipynb](Classification/LoanCredit.ipynb)**: A notebook dedicated to predicting loan creditworthiness using supervised learning models.
- **[Rrisk_model.ipynb](Classification/Rrisk_model.ipynb)**: Risk modeling for financial products using classification algorithms.
- **[notes.ipynb](Classification/notes.ipynb)**: Supplementary notes and observations related to classification tasks.

#### Data:
- **[bureau_data.csv](Classification/data/bureau_data.csv)**: Bureau data used for classification tasks.
- **[customers.csv](Classification/data/customers.csv)**: Customer demographic and financial data.
- **[loans.csv](Classification/data/loans.csv)**: Loan-related data for creditworthiness analysis.

#### Artifacts:
- **[model_data.joblib](Classification/artifacts/model_data.joblib)**: Pre-trained model data for classification tasks.

### Regression
This section focuses on regression problems, such as predicting home prices.

#### Notebooks:
- **[MultiLenReg.ipynb](Regression/MultiLenReg.ipynb)**: Multivariate linear regression for predicting financial metrics.
- **[Supervised.ipynb](Regression/Supervised.ipynb)**: General supervised regression techniques applied to financial datasets.
- **[notes.ipynb](Regression/notes.ipynb)**: Supplementary notes and observations related to regression tasks.

#### Data:
- **[home_prices.csv](Regression/data/home_prices.csv)**: Dataset containing home prices for regression analysis.
